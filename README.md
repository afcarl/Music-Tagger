# Music-Tagger
Tagging the music clips in the MagnaTagATune dataset by running convolutional neural networks on log amplitude mel-spectrograms generated using [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa). The models are written on [Totem](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Totem). Work still in progress.

## Results:

The model described in model1.py gives a peak ROC_AUC score of 0.877.
Other models to be tested
